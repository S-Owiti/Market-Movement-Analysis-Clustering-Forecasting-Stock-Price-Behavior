### 2. Data Preprocessing

**2.1 Data Loading and Initial Exploration**

The dataset was loaded from a CSV file containing Stock data. The initial exploration revealed the following:

+ **Dataset Shape:** The dataset contains 497472 rows and 7 columns.
+ **Data Types:** The dataset includes both numerical and categorical features, such as Symbol, Close, and Volume.
+ **Missing Values:** Initial checks showed missing values in columns Open, High, and Low.
+ **Key Initial Statistics:**
      - Total Records: 497472 rows
      - Original Features: 7 columns 
      - Missing Values: 27 cells

**2.2 Handling Missing Values**

Imputed or dropped depending on context.

**2.3 Data Cleaning**

- **Date Formats:** Converted date to datetime64 to enable accurate time-based grouping and calculations.
- **Duplicates:** Checked: 0 duplicates found.
- **Sorted the dataset** by symbol and date to maintain temporal accuracy.
- **Price Consistency Validation**
      Ensured that each row met the rule:
      low â‰¤ close â‰¤ high. 
      9 rows eliminated for violating this rule:
      df = df[(df['low'] <= df['close']) & (df['close'] <= df['high'])]
- **Handling Outliers** No outliers were detected.

**2.4 Feature Engineering**

New columns were added to enhance analysis, clustering, and forecasting:

| Feature            | Description                                           |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `z_close`          | Z-score of the closing price, used to detect outliers |
| `MA7`              | 7-day moving average of the `close` price             |
| `Volatility`       | 7-day rolling standard deviation of the `close` price |
| `Return`           | % Change in close price per day (unsmoothed)          |
| `Lag_1_close`      | Previous dayâ€™s closing price                          |
| `Lag_7_volume`     | Trading volume from 7 days prior                      |
| `Daily_Return`     | Day-over-day return in decimal                        |
| `Daily_Return (%)` | Day-over-day return expressed as a percentage         |

**Why Rolling Averages?**

- Helps smooth market noise to better spot trends,
- Makes visualizations more meaningful,
- Essential for comparing short-term (7-day) vs long-term (30-day) price behavior,
- Supports better segmentation and forecasting accuracy,

**2.5 Data Preparation Summary**

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Objective:** Explore patterns, distributions, and relationships within the dataset to guide clustering and modeling decisions.

**3.1 Feature Aggregation Strategy**

- To prepare for clustering:
- Aggregated engineered features per symbol to analyze stock behaviors holistically.
- Determined key clustering features using exploratory visuals:
- Pairplots for separation
- Distribution plots for skewness
- Correlation matrices
- Boxplots per symbol

**3.2 Univariate Analysis**

- Close with values ranging between 0 and 400
- MA7 with values ranging between 0 and 250
- Volatility with values ranging between 0 and 10
- Daily_Return with values ranging between -0.1 to +0.1
- Volume with values ranging between 0 and 4 (in millions)

**3.3 Bivariate Analysis**

Daily Return vs Volatility:
 - A loose positive relationship was observed â€” more volatile stocks tend to swing harder on returns.
 - Concentration is highest for daily returns between -0.4 and +0.4, and volatility under 80M.

**3.4 Correlation Matrix**

**Key finding:**

- **Perfect positive correlations:** Close and MA7, these two variables move together and are likely redundant.
- **Strong positive correlations:** Close and Volatility, MA7 and Volatility. As one increases, the other tends
to increase significantly â€” a strong signal.
- **Weak positive correlations:** Close and Daily_Return. As one increases, the other tends to increase relatively â€” a weak signal.
- **Very weak negative correlations:** Close and volume, MA7 and volume, Volatility and volume, Daily_Return and volatility. A slight inverse relationship, but it's noise.
- **Practically zero correlations:** MA7 and Daily_Return, Volatility and Daily_Return. These variables are completely unrelated.

**3.5 Time Series Trends**

Stocks show varied behavior over time; some, like AAP and AAPL, display smooth upward trends, while others, like AAL, show erratic movement.

**3.6 Rolling Behavior Analysis**

**Visualizing MA7 against volatility bands:**
- Highest trend values approached 200, lowest around 80
- Volatility bands revealed stability zones and spikes across time windows.

**3.7 Multivariate Pattern Detection**

The pairplot reveals natural clustering tendencies, particularly between MA7, Volatility, and Daily Return.

**3.8 Top Stocks by Movement & Trade Volume**

| REGN      9.06           | MSFT    30M            |
| AZO       7.87           | FB      29M            |
| BIIB      6.28           | CHK     28M            |
| MTD       4.59           | MU      27M            |
| BLK       4.45           | INTC    27M            |

Insight: PCLN leads in volatility by far, while BAC and AAPL dominate in trading volume, making them the perfect candidates for deeper behavioral clustering.

### 4. Time Series Forecasting

The final analytical phase of the project involved building predictive models to forecast stock prices over time. One representative stock was selected from each behavioral cluster (as determined in the clustering phase) to capture their unique time-dependent dynamics:
- Stock 0 â†’ Cluster 0: Aggressive Growth
- Stock 1 â†’ Cluster 1: Low-Volatility Blue Chips

**4.1 Time Series EDA**

Each stockâ€™s historical performance was analyzed visually and statistically:

**ðŸ”¹ Stock 0**
- Opened at ~400 in Jan 2014, spiked to ~1200 in Jan 2018
- Dipped below 400 in January 2015, with key volatility around January 2016, July, and Dec

**ðŸ”¹ Stock 1**
- Rose from ~80 in Jan 2014 to ~180 in Jan 2018
- Lowest dip observed below 50 in Feb 2014, with fluctuations primarily between 2015â€“2017

Both series were resampled to a monthly frequency to stabilize seasonal patterns. Visual trend analysis identified:
- Spikes in mid-year periods (especially July)
- Dips typically occur around January or year-end

**4.2 Stationarity Testing**

The **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF)** test was applied to assess stationarity:

| Stock       | ADF Statistic   |  p-value  |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Stock_0     | -2.40           |  0.14     |
| Stock_1     | -1.06           |  0.73     | 

**âž¡ Observation:** Both time series were non-stationary (p > 0.05), necessitating differencing before ARIMA modeling.

**4.3 Forecast Modeling**

**ðŸ”¸ ARIMA Model**

A (1,1,1) ARIMA model was applied to each stock. 
**Key model insights:**

**Stock 0:**
+ Highly volatile with substantial noise
+ Model performance metrics:
      - AIC: 154.45
      - BIC: 157.99
      - Skew: -4.00
      - Kurtosis: 19.28 (heavy tails)

**Stock 1:**
+ Smoother trend with better-behaved residuals
+ Model performance metrics:
      - AIC: 12.87
      - BIC: 16.40
      - Skew: 4.17
      - Kurtosis: 19.72

**ðŸ”¸ Prophet Model**

Meta (Facebook) Prophet was applied for more flexible and visual forecasting. 
**Key observations:**

**Stock 0:**
- Lowest dip: ~300 (Feb 2015)
- Strong upward trend: ~580 (Feb 2017), peaking near 780 by early 2017

**Stock 1:**
- Lowest dip: ~105 (Jan 2016)
- Peak: ~148 (Jan 2017)

Prophet effectively captured cyclical behavior and sudden growth bursts in both stocks.

**4.4 Forecast Accuracy Evaluation**

Using MAE and RMSE to assess model accuracy:

| Stock   | MAE      |  RMSE     | Interpretation                                                         |
|---------|----------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Stock_0 | 466.23   |  487.24   | High error due to unpredictable, volatile behavior (aggressive growth) |
| Stock_1 | 24.74    |  26.78    | Significantly lower error â€” highly forecastable and stable             |

**âž¡ The results** reinforce the behavioral traits identified during clustering:
- Cluster 0 stocks are difficult to forecast, volatile, and prone to spikes
- Cluster 1 stocks are forecast-friendly and trend smoothly over time

**5. Conclusion**

This project set out to explore, cluster, and forecast stock market behavior through a full-cycle data science workflow â€” from raw data wrangling to strategic forecasting. Using historical stock price data, we developed a 360Â° view of market movement by engineering meaningful features, uncovering behavioral groupings, and building models to predict future trends.

**ðŸ”¹ Key Milestones:**

**1. Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**

 Raw data was transformed through rolling averages, volatility calculations, and return features to better capture stock movement patterns over time.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

 EDA uncovered insights into price trends, feature distributions, inter-feature correlations, and temporal behavior. Stocks were seen to vary widely in risk, volatility, and performance, setting the stage for segmentation.

**3. Clustering**

 Using K-Means, stocks were clustered into two distinct groups:
 - Cluster 0 â€“ Aggressive Growth: High volatility, high returns, sharp price swings
 - Cluster 1 â€“ Low-Volatility Blue Chips: Stable, slow-moving, forecastable performers

 These clusters formed the foundation for behavior-aware forecasting strategies.

**Time Series Forecasting**

 Representative stocks from each cluster were selected for time-based modeling using ARIMA and Facebook Prophet. 
 **Results showed:**
 - High forecast error for Cluster 0 stocks due to chaotic movement
 - Strong forecast accuracy for Cluster 1 stocks with smooth, consistent patterns
 
 This confirmed the importance of behavioral clustering before predictive modeling.

**Project Impact**

This end-to-end analysis demonstrates how integrating unsupervised learning (clustering) with time series forecasting can enhance both interpretability and accuracy in financial data modeling. By understanding behavior first, weâ€™re able to tailor forecasting strategies to stock personality, bridging analytics with decision-making.With the full project now complete, these insights can be extended into:
- Portfolio simulations by cluster behavior
- Real-time monitoring dashboards (Power BI or Streamlit)
- Scaling to include social sentiment + volume analysis for high-volatility stocks

Time series forecasting confirmed the strategic validity of behavior-based clustering. While high-growth stocks present greater forecasting challenges, stable performers yield more reliable projections, providing a clear pathway for building tailored prediction models based on cluster characteristics.
